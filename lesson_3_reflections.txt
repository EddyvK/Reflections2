When would you want to create a remote repository rathen than keeping all your work local?

1) When you work on several computers
2) When you work with others
3) When you want an extra backup

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Pulling updates manually has the same cause as committing manually
